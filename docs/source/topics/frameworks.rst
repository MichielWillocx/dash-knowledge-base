TensorFlow Federated
-----------------------------------
Developed by Google, TensorFlow Federated (TFF) is a Python-based, open-source framework for training machine learning models on decentralized data. This framework has been pioneering the experimentation with federated learning as an approach.

TFF performs in two main API layers:

- Federated Learning (FL) API offers high-level interfaces that enable developers to plug existing machine learning models to TFF without the need to dive deeply into how federated learning works.
    
- Federated Core (FC) API offers low-level interfaces that provide opportunities to build novel federated algorithms.


OpenFL
-----------------------------------
Developed by Intel, OpenFL (Open Federated Learning) is an open-source framework that leverages the data-private federated learning paradigm for training ML algorithms. The framework comes with a command-line interface and a Python API. Open FL can work with training pipelines built with PyTorch and TensorFlow while it can go beyond and work with other frameworks.


OpenFL
-----------------------------------
IBM Federated Learning is a framework that promises data scientists and machine learning engineers an easy integration of federated learning workflows within the enterprise environment. This federated learning framework supports a variety of algorithms, topologies, and protocols out-of-the-box, including

- Linear classifiers/regressions,
- Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms,
- Na√Øve Bayes,
- Decision Tree, and
- Models written in Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, to name a few.

Not to mention that researchers in the field of federated learning can use the existing functionality of the framework to fit the specific needs of their organization or the particular application domain.
